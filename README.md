Starting my coding adventure
I've been teaching myself HTML5 and CSS from books. Now I'm starting a web developer Udemy boot camp. I think this is the perfect place to store all I work on so if I get stuck on something I have a place to share what's happening. For now, I am using the free service while I'm learning.
